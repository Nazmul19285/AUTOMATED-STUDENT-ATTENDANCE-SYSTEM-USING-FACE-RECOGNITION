# Face-Recognition-based-Classroom-Attendance-System
This is my University final project. It has a purpose of making a fully automatic functional attendance system. However, I'm working on it to make it more realistic.


## Features

1. The system can read class routines and select the current class
2. It takes snapshots and recognizes the person
3. After recognizing counts the attendance 
4. And updates the attendance marks
